# Maths-in-Action
4th Year Maths in Action project on neural networks and reinforcement learning.

The most important file to look through is Results.ipynb.
This shows off all of the results and statistics obtained for the report,
as well as game-play between trained networks for Connect 4 and noughts and crosses.

The file GameReplays.ipynb shows off some extra game-play between networks,
although most of these games are found in Results.ipynb. If the videos can't be
played in GitHub then feel free to directly access them from the Replays folder and 
see the corresponding README.txt file found in Replays for brief explanations of each them.

There are 4 files that constitute the main code of the project:
1) NeuralNetworks.ipynb
2) ImprovedNeuralNetworks.ipynb  (This makes NeuralNetworks.ipynb obsolete)
3) ReinforcementLearning.ipynb
4) ImprovedReinforcementLearning.ipynb  (This makes ReinforcementLearning.ipynb obsolete)

These are heavily commented and each come with their own summary at the top.

There is also an additional file called GameCode.ipynb that I wrote for the
implementation of the games Connect 4 and noughts and crosses into Python
