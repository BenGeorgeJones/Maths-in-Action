# Maths-in-Action
4th Year Maths in Action project on neural networks and reinforcement learning.

The most important file to look through is Results.ipynb.
This shows off all of the results and statistics obtained for the report,
as well as game-play between trained networks for Connect 4 and noughts and crosses.

The file GameReplays.ipynb shows off some extra game-play between network,
although most of these games are found in Results.ipynb. 

There are 4 files that constitute the main code of the project:
1) NeuralNetworks.ipynb
2) ImprovedNeuralNetworks.ipynb  (This makes NeuralNetworks.ipynb obsolete)
3) ReinforcementLearning.ipynb
4) ImprovedReinforcementLearning.ipynb  (This makes ReinforcementLearning.ipynb obsolete)
These are heavily commented and each come with their own summary at the top.

There is also an additional file called GameCode.ipynb that I wrote for the
implementation of the games Connect 4 and noughts and crosses into python
