If the videos aren't showing in Results.ipynb or GameReplays.ipynb then they can 
instead be downloaded and watched from this folder. In order they are:

1) noughts_and_crosses_game.mp4
This shows a solved game of noughts and crosses by two fully trained networks.

2) early_game.mp4
This shows a Connect 4 game taken very early on in training.

3) intermediate_game.mp4
This shows an intermediate Connect 4 game from training where player 2 learns to block player 1 for the first time.

4) standard_nets_final_game.mp4
This shows the final Connect 4 game between the two fully connected networks after their training.

5) convolutional_nets_final_game.mp4
This shows the highest level of game-play in Connect 4 which was achieved after training two convolutional neural networks.
